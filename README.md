Interactive_Human_figure
========================
This project is a part of UDHC project --> https://github.com/sbose78/udhc-eclipse

This module is used to pin point issues and solutions on a human figure captured through 
patient input process and the analysis made by the caregiver.

Possible list of organ values that can be used
===============================================

["Liver","Spleen","Heart","Lungs","Aorta","Kidneys","Stomach","Pancreas",
"Abdominal Aorta","Small Intestine","Appendix","Urinay Bladder","Genitalia","Brain"] 

The data object containes the information about each encounter:

var data={"E1":{"organ":"Brain","input":"Input","output":"40% blockage"},"E2":{"organ":"Lungs","input":"Input","output":"Throat-Infection"}};

The plan is the receive an ajax response in the form of an array for EACH ENCOUNTER like this: 

{"organ":"Brain","input":"Input","output":"40% blockage"}

Store them using any autogenerated unique key like i have used E1,E2 in the data object. 
The key is never used it only needs to be unique.

Thats it!

If you are realigning the divs and image then will have to adjust the co-ordinates of the nodes but thats a one time job.
