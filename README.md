printable_summary


How data is to be recieved,stored and manipulated:
===================================================

Inside the printable_summary file you will find the object "data".

The data object is an object array which will contain the information about each encounter in this form:

var data={"E1":{"organ":"Brain","input":"Input","output":"40% blockage"},"E2":{"organ":"Lungs","input":"Input","output":"Throat-Infection"}};

The plan is the receive an ajax response in the form of an array for EACH ENCOUNTER like this: 

{"organ":"Brain","input":"Input","output":"40% blockage"}

And then Store them in 'data' using any autogenerated unique key like I have used E1,E2 in the data object.The key is never used it only needs to be unique.


Thats it! The function exec will read from the data object and display as planned.

If you are realigning the divs and image then will have to adjust the co-ordinates of the nodes but thats a one time job. Will have to modify the x and y values once before drawing the nodes.
